description: >-
  Read a YouTube Studio audience-retention export and find where viewers
  actually leave, then say what to change. Use for "why do people stop
  watching", "my retention is bad", a pasted retention chart or CSV, or
  "fix my pacing". Also for Russian requests: "разбери удержание", "почему
  зрители уходят", "выгрузка из YouTube Studio", "график удержания
  аудитории".

# yt-retention

The retention graph is the only honest feedback YouTube gives you. Almost nobody exports it.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/retention.py" retention.csv --duration 600
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/retention.py" retention.csv --transcript transcript.srt
```

Getting the file: Studio -> a video -> Analytics -> Engagement -> the audience-retention chart ->
the download icon -> "Audience retention".

## Three different problems

- **HOOK LEAK** - what is lost in the first 30 seconds. Under 25% is healthy. This is always the
  first thing to fix and it is always the first fifteen seconds of script, never the edit.
- **CLIFFS** - single steep drops. A cliff is a moment: a topic change with no signposting, a
  sponsor read, a long setup. With `--transcript` the tool prints what was being said there, which
  is what makes the report actionable instead of interesting.
- **SLIDE** - the steady bleed across the middle. A flat slide is pacing. The fix is cutting, not
  rewriting.

## What to hand back

Name the single biggest leak and one change for it. Not a list of five. Then, only if asked, the
rest. And if the hook leak is healthy and the slide is flat, say the video is fine and the problem
is packaging - send them to `/yt-package`.

## Russian-language mode

When the user writes in Russian, or the material (a transcript, titles, an export) is Russian:

- Answer in Russian, in plain spoken language, without bureaucratic words (данный, является,
  осуществлять) and without machine-written stamps («не X, а Y», «давайте разберёмся», lead-in
  questions like «Знаешь, почему?»). Keep «ты» or «вы» exactly as the
  voice profile sets it, the same way from start to end.
- Take tone and format from [examples_ru.md](examples_ru.md). The examples are format samples, not
  facts: never quote their numbers or present them as real channels or real results.
- The tools detect Russian on their own (`--lang ru` forces it) and report in Russian.
- `retention.py` reads Russian Studio exports - decimal comma, ";" between columns, Russian headers,
  the zip Studio downloads - and reports in Russian.
- The Russian names of Studio's columns are not yet confirmed on a real export. If the tool says it
  found no retention column, ask which column is the retention and pass a file with just the
  position and retention columns.
- For a Short the hook is the first 10% of the video (3 to 30 seconds), not the first 30 seconds.

## Running the tools

The scripts sit next to this SKILL.md. `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` in the commands is this skill's folder:
Claude Code shows it as the skill's base directory; on claude.ai it is the folder this SKILL.md was
read from, so put that path in if the shell does not know the variable. If `python3` is not found
(Windows), run the same command with `python`. The scripts need Python 3.9 or newer and nothing
else, read and write only the files you give them, and never touch the network.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
